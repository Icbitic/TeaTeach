## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-XX

### Security Fixes üîí

#### Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Removed authentication backdoor in `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`
  - Eliminated `check-ignore` parameter that allowed bypassing JWT authentication
  - All API endpoints now properly require valid JWT tokens
  - **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized admin access to the system

- **HIGH**: Secured hardcoded credentials in configuration files
  - Moved database passwords to environment variables (`DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`)
  - Moved JWT secret to environment variable (`JWT_SECRET`)
  - Moved email credentials to environment variables (`MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`)
  - **Impact**: Prevents credential exposure in version control

- **MEDIUM**: Enhanced SSL/TLS configuration
  - Enabled SSL for database connections (`useSSL=true`)
  - **Impact**: Encrypts database communication

#### Security Enhancements

- **Enhanced JWT token validation**
  - Added null and empty string validation
  - Improved token expiration checking
  - Better error handling for invalid tokens
  - Added runtime exception for malformed tokens

- **Added security headers**
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with 1-year max-age
  - Enhanced CORS configuration

- **Improved authorization controls**
  - Added explicit admin endpoint protection (`/api/admin/**`)
  - Added health check endpoint for monitoring (`/actuator/health`)
  - Maintained role-based access control for student and teacher endpoints

### Added üì¶

- **Environment Configuration**
  - Created `.env.example` template file with all required environment variables
  - Added comprehensive environment variable documentation
  - Included secure JWT secret generation instructions

- **Security Documentation**
  - Created `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive security guidelines
  - Added deployment security checklist
  - Included security best practices for developers and administrators
  - Added vulnerability reporting guidelines

- **Enhanced .gitignore**
  - Added environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.)
  - Added sensitive configuration files (`.key`, `.pem`, `.p12`, `.jks`)
  - Improved coverage for secret files

  - Updated `sass-loader` from `^12.0.0` to `^16.0.3`

- **Configuration Improvements**
  - All sensitive configuration now uses environment variables
  - Improved error handling in JWT service
  - Enhanced security filter configuration

### Security Impact Assessment

#### Before Fixes
- ‚ùå Authentication could be bypassed with a simple URL parameter
- ‚ùå Database credentials exposed in configuration files
- ‚ùå JWT secrets exposed in configuration files
- ‚ùå Email credentials exposed in configuration files
- ‚ùå Insecure database connections (no SSL)
- ‚ùå Missing security headers
- ‚ùå Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities

#### After Fixes
- ‚úÖ Robust JWT-based authentication required for all protected endpoints
- ‚úÖ All sensitive credentials secured with environment variables
- ‚úÖ SSL-encrypted database connections
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security headers implemented
- ‚úÖ Updated dependencies with latest security patches
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security documentation and guidelines

### Migration Guide

For existing deployments, follow these steps:

1. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

2. **Generate secure JWT secret**:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

3. **Update environment variables** in your deployment:
   - `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`
   - `JWT_SECRET` (use generated value)
   - `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`

4. **Update frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm update
   ```

5. **Test the application** thoroughly after deployment

### Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Environment variables are now required** for:
  - Database connection (`DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`)
  - JWT authentication (`JWT_SECRET`)
  - Email functionality (`MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`)

- **Frontend dependencies** may require code updates due to major version changes:
  - Vue I18n upgraded to v10 (check for API changes)
  - ESLint upgraded to v8 (may require configuration updates)

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Deploy these security fixes as soon as possible
   - Rotate all existing JWT secrets
   - Review access logs for any suspicious activity

2. **Ongoing Security**:
   - Implement regular dependency updates
   - Set up automated security scanning
   - Monitor application logs for security events
   - Conduct regular security audits
