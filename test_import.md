# Student Import Feature Test

## Backend Implementation Complete

The student import functionality has been successfully implemented in the backend:

### 1. StudentService.java
- Added `importStudentsFromExcel(MultipartFile file)` method
- Supports .xlsx, .xls, and .csv file formats
- Validates student data before import
- Prevents duplicate students (by studentId)
- Handles multiple date formats
- Robust error handling for individual rows

### 2. StudentController.java
- Added `POST /api/students/import` endpoint
- Returns structured response with success status and imported count
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 3. Frontend Integration
- The frontend `studentService.js` already has the `importStudents` method
- The Vue.js component `HomeView.vue` has the import dialog and file handling

## Expected Excel Format

The import expects an Excel file with the following columns:
1. ID (auto-generated, can be empty)
2. Student ID (required)
3. Name (required)
4. Email (required, must contain @)
5. Major (optional)
6. Date of Birth (optional, supports multiple formats)

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully imported 5 students",
  "importedCount": 5,
  "students": [...]
}
```

## Error Handling

- File validation (empty files, unsupported formats)
- Data validation (required fields, email format)
- Duplicate prevention (by studentId)
- Row-level error handling (continues processing other rows)
- Comprehensive error messages

## Testing

To test the import functionality:
1. Create an Excel file with student data
2. Use the import dialog in the frontend
3. Check the response for success/error status
4. Verify students are added to the database
